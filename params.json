{"name":"Narrative","tagline":"A Student Information System built around creating narrative student progress reports for Montessori and Waldorf-style educational environments","google":"","body":"### A Student Information System for Small Montessori- and Waldorf-type Schools.\r\nThis Student Information System was developed originally to aid teachers in the creation of narrative reports for their students. Routine tasks such as creation of starting templates are semi-automated so teachers can focus on the core uniqueness of each student's progress. The system is also designed for fast and easy generation of student reports. Before this system was in place, our school secretary took as much as 80 hours to compile the hodgepodge of text documents teachers would submit. Teachers often used copy-paste to create new student reports and overlooked changes in gender and even student names. This system helps reduce this to near elimination. Compilation of reports for sending home to parents only takes about 5 hours. \r\n\r\nSince its inception in 2009 it has gone through many changes and expansions. Now the system provides teachers and school administrators access to all student progress data from class grades to attendance and student learning accommodations (such as IEPs). Future possible features may include the addition of parent and guardian information and student health and emergency information. Right now it is focused solely on the academic side of student information. \r\n\r\nBuilt using the CodeIgniter Framework, this application can be run on any php/MySQL web server, but has only been tested on Unix and Linux-based apache server configurations. \r\n\r\n### Configuration and Installation\r\nThis application has not yet been set up for easy installation by other schools. I have not yet created an installer or other tools to get the system up and running. My hope is to have this completed by version 6. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@fsmn is the author of this project.
