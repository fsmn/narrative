The process of grade management requires the following tables

assignment (kAssignment, assignment, date, category*, points) are grade categories more global or can they be added on the fly?

grade (kStudent, kTeach, kAssignment, points), neeed to have a verification process to make sure that the points given do not exceed the points of kAssignment
Points can include an excused option that disregards the assignment from the student final grade. 


AN INTERESTING PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR 1:N JOINS ON A SINGLE ROW.
